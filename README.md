mushroom classifier


Task requirement:

This dataset is based on Mushroom records extracted from The Audubon Society Field
Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). The task is: given 22 discrete-valued attributes (some
binary valued, others with up to 10 possible values) describing the physical features of a mushroom,
build a decision tree classifier that will classify each example as either edible or poisonous.
